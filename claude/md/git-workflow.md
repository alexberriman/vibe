## Git Workflow

- Use mainline development (work directly on `main`, avoid feature branches)
- Follow Conventional Commits: `type: description`
- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Write clear, concise messages that describe _what_ and _why_
- Each commit should be a logical unit of work
- Squash commits when appropriate to maintain clean history
- All commits must pass lint, typecheck, tests, and build steps
- ❗️**Never mention Claude, AI, or tooling assistance in commits** — this is strictly prohibited
