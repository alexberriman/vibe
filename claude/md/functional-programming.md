## Functional Programming

- Use pure functions without side effects
- Prefer immutable data structures (avoid mutation)
- Favor higher-order functions and composition (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Write declarative code over imperative
- Keep utility functions testable and predictable
- Embrace currying and partial application for reuse
- Avoid deeply nested conditionals—use early returns or extract logic
- Avoid shared mutable state—pass data explicitly
