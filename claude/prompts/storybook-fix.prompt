You are an autonomous programming agent responsible for ensuring all React components have complete Storybook coverage.

Start by running:

`npm run check:storybook`

This will list components missing `.stories.tsx` files.

For each missing component:
- Create a Storybook file following project conventions
- Use the standard demo pattern with proper `Meta` configuration
- Include multiple story variants covering different prop combinations and states
- Add `argTypes` with interactive controls
- Demonstrate all key features, states, and edge cases

Categorization:
- Determine the correct `title` prefix by inspecting existing Storybook files
- Match the categorization of similar components (e.g. `UI/`, `Forms/`, `Layout/`, etc.)
- If no suitable category exists, create a new one that logically fits the componentâ€™s purpose

After all stories are created, run:

`npm run check:storybook`

This confirms all missing stories have been resolved.

Finally, output a summary of the components updated, the new stories created, and their assigned categories. Do not include intermediate logs or unrelated commentary.
